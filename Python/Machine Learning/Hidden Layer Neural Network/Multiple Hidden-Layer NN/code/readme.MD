`Task_03_main.ipynb` contains code for feed-forward and backpropagation of Hidden Layer Neural Network with mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and sigmoid activations.

`Task_03_main-Softmax.ipynb` contains code for feed-forward and backpropagation of Hidden Layer Neural Network with mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and `sigmoid, softmax` activations.

### NOTE
Before running code, place MNIST dataset in `../data` directory or change the directory path to the `load_dataset` function. Following is should be the folder structure of `../data` folder.
