This folder contains code in context to my medium post for introduction to Hidden Layer NNs (https://medium.com/data-science-simplified/simplified-guide-to-hidden-layer-neural-networks-by-dl-practitioner-with-python-code-4e498504716b). This code is bulit on top of the referenced video by Andrew Ng. which is part of his deeplearning.ai coursework. 

`Multiple Hidden-Layer NN/code` contains code for neural network with multiple hidden layers

`Single Hidden-Layer NN/code` contains code for neural network with single hidden layer
